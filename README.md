- Refresh Token Handling: Implement refresh tokens to maintain user sessions.

- Repository Pattern with UnitOfWork: Structured data access with repository and unit of work patterns.

- ASP.NET Identity: User management system.

- CRUD Endpoints: Basic API endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

- Pagination and Filtering: Implement pagination and filtering for data retrieval.
